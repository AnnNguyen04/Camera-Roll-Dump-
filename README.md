There is a vast selection of raw fish which is always fresh and rich with flavor, a deifnate must-try from me!

Ramen is soup-noodle dish oftens erved with porkbelly, a gooey egg, and some veggies, I definately reccomend trying some authentic ramen in Japan. You can find a delicious ramen shop every mile. 

### Nara Deer Park
