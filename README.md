THE POPCORN CHICKEN WAS SO CRUNCHY, YET SO JUICY! I loved the japanese spin on popcorn chicken.

There is a vast selection of raw fish which is always fresh and rich with flavor, a definate must-try from me!

Ramen is soup-noodle dish often served with porkbelly, a gooey egg, and some veggies; I definately reccomend trying some authentic ramen in Japan. You can find a delicious ramen shop every mile in the city. 

### Nara Deer Park

The deer walk right up to you and they'll even bow if you have food. The food is an optional buy of course but it's quite affordable as well as well as a garunteed fun time!

#### Second-hand Shopping

Second-hand shopping/ thrifting in Japan was one of my favorite things to do hands down. Not only can you find really good prices, but the items are generally trendy and in great condition! 

##### Visit Temples

I can't even remember how many temples I visited, but this image I was able to capture is by far my favorite. The tour guides are always so passionate and have amazing stories to tell about the ancient histories of each temple. It's very relaxing and you also get a good workout walking around the sites.
